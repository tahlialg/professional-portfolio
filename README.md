# professional-portfolio

## Project Background
I created a professional portfolio site to showcase my HTML and CSS skills and talents learnt in the UWA Bootcamp for future employment. The portfolio is intended to take on a minimalistic design, whilst being visually aesthetic to the viewer.

## Course of Action
- Navigation bar with links to different sections.
- Image of myself and a brief bio contained underneath.
- My projects that I have and will complete.
- Links to where people can connect with me.
- A responsive design layout for reformatted screen sizing.
